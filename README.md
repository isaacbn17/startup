[My notes.md file](notes.md)

## Elevator Pitch

This is going to be **BIG**!

How much time is wasted when a group can't make a decision quickly?
How can you easily tell what everyone in a group wants to do?
Introducing the solution - a free group voting software that will allow users to:
* Easily create questions and answers
* Collect votes from participants
* See the results in real time

It'll be quick, efficient, and let you know exactly what you need to!
